## Step 0 Loading library and dataset

```
#library
library(dplyr)
#dataset
anime <- read.csv("D:/IT/IT Y.2/INT214 Stat for IT/R/Midterm assignment/anime_clean.csv)
```

## 1.

Explain here
```
pokemon %>% filter( pokemon$Type == "DARK",pokemon$Total > 600)
```
Result

```

## 2.

Explain here
```
distinct(pokemon,pokemon$Type, .keep_all = FALSE)
pokemonAverage <- aggregate(pokemon$Special_Defense, list(pokemon$Type), FUN=mean)
pokemonAverage <- pokemonAverage %>% rename(Type=Group.1,Average_Speed_Defense = x)
pokemonAverage %>% filter(pokemonAverage$Average_Speed_Defense == max(pokemonAverage$Average_Speed_Defense))
```
Result
```
     Type Average_Speed_Defense

## 3. 

Explain here
```
pokemon %>% select(Name,Speed) %>% filter(pokemon$Speed == min(pokemon$Speed))
pokemon %>% select(Name,Speed) %>% filter(pokemon$Speed == max(pokemon$Speed))

max(pokemon$Speed)-min(pokemon$Speed)
```
Result
```
