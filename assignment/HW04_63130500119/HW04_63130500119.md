Dataset:
1. Top 270 Computer Science / Programing Books (Data from Thomas Konstantin, [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/thomaskonstantin/top-270-rated-computer-science-programing-books)) >> [Using CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/prog_book.csv)

### Outlines
1. Explore the dataset
2. Learning function from Tidyverse
3. Transform data with dplyr and finding insight the data
4. Visualization with GGplot2

## Part 1: Explore the dataset

```
# Library
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(tidyr)
library(assertive)
library(readr)
library(psych)
library(data.table)

# Dataset
topCSBook<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/prog_book.csv")

View(topCSBook)
topCSBook <- as_tibble(topCSBook)

glimpse(topCSBook)

#Clean data

topCSBook$Reviews <-topCSBook$Reviews %>% str_remove(",")
topCSBook$Reviews <- as.numeric(topCSBook$Reviews)
typeof(topCSBook$Reviews)

colnames(topCSBook)

range(topCSBook$Rating)
range(topCSBook$Reviews)
range(topCSBook$Number_Of_Pages)
range(topCSBook$Price)
```

In this dataset has 7 column which are Rating, Reviews, Book_title, Description, Number_Of_Pages, Type, Price every column is a numeric data 

except Book_titla and Description which is character

```
the range of the Rating     is between 3    and    5 
the range of the Reviews    is between 0    and 5938
the range of the Book_title is between 50   and 3168
the range of the Price      is between 9.32 and  235.65
```

## Part 2: Learning function from Tidyverse and Transform data with dplyr and finding insight the data

#1 What is the maximum rating of each (books) type and which type is the maximum

```
distinct(topCSBook,topCSBook$Type, .keep_all = FALSE)

topCSBookaverage <- aggregate(topCSBook$Rating, list(topCSBook$Type), FUN=max)
topCSBookaverage <- topCSBookaverage %>% rename(Book_Type=Group.1,Highest_Rating = x)
topCSBookaverage %>% filter(topCSBookaverage$Highest_Rating == max(topCSBookaverage$Highest_Rating))

```

Result:

```

  Book_Type                Highest_Rating
1 Boxed Set - Hardcover    4.49
2 ebook                    5.00
3 Hardcover                4.77
4 Kindle Edition           4.35
5 Paperback                4.72
6 Unknown Binding          4.11

-----------------------------------------

  Book_Type Highest_Rating
1     ebook              5

```
```
the highest rate of reating in Unknown Binding books        is 4.11

the highest rate of reating in Kindle Edition books         is 4.35

the highest rate of reating in Boxed Set - Hardcover books  is 4.49

the highest rate of reating in Paperback books              is 4.72

the highest rate of reating in Hardcover books              is 4.77

the highest rate of reating in ebook books                  is 5.00 

(whis is the highest of all!!)
```

#2 which type of books have the gratest amount? and which one have the leatest? how ists diffrence?

```
topCSBookType <- data.frame(table(topCSBook$Type))
topCSBookType <- topCSBookType %>% rename(Type=Var1)
topCSBookType <- topCSBookType %>% rename(Amount=Freq)
topCSBookType %>% filter(Amount == max(Amount))
topCSBookType %>% filter(Amount == min(Amount))

max(topCSBookType$Amount)-min(topCSBookType$Amount)

```

Result:

```

       Type   Amount
1 Paperback      156

-----------------------------------------

                   Type   Amount
1 Boxed Set - Hardcover        1

-----------------------------------------

155

```
```
there are 156 books that is PaperBack which is the maximum amount of all the types

and there is only 1 books that consider in a Boxed Set - Hardcover  which is the maximum amount of all the types

the different of the maximum and minimum amount is 155

```
#3 what is the avereage books pages of all the books ? and which book have number of pages grater than the average ?
```

mean(topCSBook$Number_Of_Pages)
topCSBook%>%select(Book_title,Number_Of_Pages)%>%filter(topCSBook$Number_Of_Pages>mean(topCSBook$Number_Of_Pages))%>% slice_head(n=5) %>% arrange(desc(Number_Of_Pages))

```

Result:

```

475.0775
-----------------------------------------

 Book_title                                    Number_Of_Pages
  <chr>                                                 <int>

5 The Information: A History, a Theory, a~                527

```
```
the average number of the books pages is 475.0775

the top 5 books that their pages are more than the averages book pages (order by descending order) are
1 Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Projec~ which contains 560 pages
2 Agile Web Development with Rails: A Pra~ which contains 558 pages
3 The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers,~ which contains 542 pages
4 The Strangest Man: The Hidden Life of P~ which contains 539 pages
5 The Information: A History, a Theory, a~ which contains 527 pages

## Part 4: Visualization with GGplot2
### 1.) Graph show relation between height and mass
```
scat_plot <- starwars %>% filter(mass<500) %>% ggplot(aes(x=height,y=mass))+
  geom_point(aes(color=gender))

scat_plot+geom_smooth()
```
Result:

![Graph 1](graph1.png)
