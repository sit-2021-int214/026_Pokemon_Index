**Created by Siraphop Pattaragatewit (ID: 63130500119)**

Dataset:
1. Top 270 Computer Science / Programing Books (Data from Thomas Konstantin, [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/thomaskonstantin/top-270-rated-computer-science-programing-books)) >> [Using CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/prog_book.csv)

### Outlines
1. Explore the dataset
2. Learning function from Tidyverse
3. Transform data with dplyr and finding insight the data
4. Visualization with GGplot2

## Part 1: Explore the dataset

```
# Library
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(tidyr)
library(assertive)
library(readr)
library(psych)
library(data.table)

# Dataset
topCSBook<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/prog_book.csv")

View(topCSBook)
topCSBook <- as_tibble(topCSBook)

glimpse(topCSBook)

#Clean data

topCSBook$Reviews <-topCSBook$Reviews %>% str_remove(",")
topCSBook$Reviews <- as.numeric(topCSBook$Reviews)
typeof(topCSBook$Reviews)

colnames(topCSBook)

range(topCSBook$Rating)
range(topCSBook$Reviews)
range(topCSBook$Number_Of_Pages)
range(topCSBook$Price)
```

In this dataset has 7 column which are Rating, Reviews, Book_title, Description, Number_Of_Pages, Type, Price every column is a numeric data 

except Book_titla and Description which is character

```
the range of the Rating     is between 3    and    5 
the range of the Reviews    is between 0    and 5938
the range of the Book_title is between 50   and 3168
the range of the Price      is between 9.32 and  235.65
```

## Part 2: Learning function from Tidyverse and Transform data with dplyr and finding insight the data

- list 1
- list 2

## Part 4: Visualization with GGplot2
### 1.) Graph show relation between height and mass
```
scat_plot <- starwars %>% filter(mass<500) %>% ggplot(aes(x=height,y=mass))+
  geom_point(aes(color=gender))

scat_plot+geom_smooth()
```
Result:
