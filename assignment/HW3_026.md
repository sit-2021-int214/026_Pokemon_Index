2.) the average of cats's body weight is around 2.7 kg, the minimum weight is 2 kg. and the maximum is 3.9 kg.
```{R}
cats$Bwt %>% min(na.rm=T)
cats$Bwt %>% max(na.rm=T)
cats$Bwt %>% mean(na.rm=T)
```

3.) 3.) the average of cats's heart weight is around 10.63 g, the minimum weight is 6.3 g. and the maximum is 20.5 g.
```{R}
cats$Hwt %>% min(na.rm=T)

cats$Hwt %>% mean(na.rm=T)
```

4.) from observing 237 student, there are 118 female, another 118 male and 1 sexuality is N/A

```{R}
survey %>% count(Smoke)

survey$Age %>% mean(na.rm=T)
```

7.) from the survey the minimum age of student is 16.75 years and the maximum is 73 years
```{R}
survey$Age %>% min(na.rm=T)
survey$Age %>% max(na.rm=T)
```
